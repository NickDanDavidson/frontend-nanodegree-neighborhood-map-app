#Neighborhood Map Project
##An Exercise in using KnockoutJS, Google Maps, and other third-party APIs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

###Getting Started

- Go to the [live page](https://nickdandavidson.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-neighborhood-map-app) in your favorite browser

- You have several options to interact with the map:
	- Click on the list of markers on the left side. This opens and closes the map's info windows.
	- Type in a name from the list in the search bar. Pressing enter will toggle the map's info windows.
	- Click on the markers themselves. This again toggles the info windows.

- Below the map is a section that provides relevant articles that link to the surrounding neighborhoods' Wikipedia entries.

I hope you enjoy my project. I appreciate any feedback you have, and I have tried to provide as thorough documentation as I can. Thank you!
