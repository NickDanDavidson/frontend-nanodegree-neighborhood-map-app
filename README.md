#Neighborhood Map Project
##An Exercise in using KnockoutJS, Google Maps, and other third-party APIs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

###Getting Started

- Open index.html in your favorite browser

- You have several options to interact with the map:
	- Click on the list of markers on the left side. This opens and closes the map's info windows.
	- (There might be a bug somewhere - sometimes when I refresh my page after making a change to the files, a couple of the markers aren't in the right order. Refreshing again fixes the issue. To check if you are experiencing this issue, the most common suspect is the first link "Anytime Fitness." If you click on this link and the info window does not appear over the light purple marker (the gym marker, although it is hard to see because a coffee marker is right on top of it), please refresh the page.)
	- Type in a name from the list in the search bar. Pressing enter will toggle the map's info windows.
	- Click on the markers themselves. This again toggles the info windows.

- Below the map is a section that provides relevant articles that link to the surrounding neighborhoods' Wikipedia entries.

I hope you enjoy my project. I appreciate any feedback you have, and I have tried to provide as thorough documentation as I can. Thank you!
